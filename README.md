# Basic HTML Page Template Explanation

This markdown file explains the components of a basic HTML page template.

## DOCTYPE Declaration
`<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document to be HTML5, which is the latest standard of HTML.

## HTML Element
`<html lang="en">`: The `<html>` tag is the root of the HTML document. The `lang` attribute specifies the language of the document, which in this case is English.

## Head Element
The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the HTML document that isn't displayed on the webpage itself.

### Meta Charset
`<meta charset="UTF-8">`: This tag specifies the character encoding for the HTML document, which is UTF-8. It includes most characters from all known languages, making it universal.

### Meta Viewport
`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: This tag is used to improve the viewing experience on mobile devices by controlling the viewport's size and scale.

### Title
`<title>Your Page Title</title>`: The `<title>` tag specifies the title of the document, which is shown in the browser's title bar or tab.

## Body Element
`<body>`: The `<body>` tag contains the content of the HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc.

### Content Placeholder
`<!-- Your content goes here -->`: This is a comment and won't appear on the webpage. It's a placeholder where you can start adding your HTML content.

## Closing Tags
`</head>`, `</body>`, and `</html>`: These are closing tags for their respective elements, signifying the end of those sections in the HTML document.
